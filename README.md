# Meditation iOS Project

This repository contains the source code for a sample meditation iOS app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or pull the repository.
2. Open `Meditation.xcodeproj` in Xcode (version 15 or later).
3. Xcode will fetch Swift packages defined in `Package.resolved` automatically.
4. Build and run the **Meditation** target.

The Firebase configuration file `GoogleService-Info.plist` is located in the `meditation/` directory and is included in the project so the app can configure Firebase at launch.
